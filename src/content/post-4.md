Sometimes we are so doubtful in life that we think that only complex solutions can solve our problems.

We fail to acknowledge the easy solutions which are around us.

I was reading by favorite bloggers post (Leo Babuata – Zen habits) and saw a simple method to go back to your “One Thing”. It is so simple and easy to follow. This simple trick combines of 3 simple methods.

By this time I am sure you are aware what’s “The One Thing”. The One Thing is that one critical item on your list that you would want to focus on to complete your most important goal. Since that goal is most important to you and you want it to be perfect, hence you start procrastinating over it thinking about the consequences rather than the process.

For example: Your “One Thing” can be to loose weight. It can be to write an article. Or it can be to study for a certification. Or it can be to prepare a financial plan for yourself.

#### Following are the 3 methods you can follow to get out of this procrastination loop:

---

> Create a space: Give yourself a distraction free 15-25 minutes by putting all your stuff (mobile, messages, social media, etc.) aside. Just take out 15-25 minutes and ignore all other stuff just for this much little time and start work on your “One Thing”. Remind yourself again and again that it is just for this time period of 15-25 minutes that you are working on. A pomodoro timer can assist you on this.

---

> Meditate: For a minute or so before you sit to start your one thing. Take few deep breaths, lighten the body, drop your shoulders, smile and relax. Nothing is bothering you. Nothing will happen in those 15-25 minutes. Keep your mind and hear open and start your work with that beautiful smile.

---

> Do the smallest next step: Now you are ready and you created the space, what comes next? Your actual work. Work might be bigger or smaller, but for now you can start the smallest possible section of the work to get the ball rolling. Even a smallest action will give you power and confidence to carry on. Combining multiple small actions done by single tasking will ensure that your big task – your one thing is on the way to the completion.

---


That’s it. Repeat these steps in the same way by starting afresh and you will see that your “One Thing” is close to completion, or at-least you are on the path of taking actions irrespective of the results.

Just breathe.

Be Awesome.

Cheers 🥂
